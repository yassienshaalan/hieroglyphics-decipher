# hieroglyphics-decipher
This repo will host my new project of hieroglyphics language translation app. The input is an image either taken instantly or uploaded to the app and an instant translation to the text will be provided in English. 
The app is built using deep learning models(including CNNs, VAEs, LSTMs). 
It is still under construction.
This code is implemented using Python 3.7, tensorflow version 1.13.0, Keras version.
